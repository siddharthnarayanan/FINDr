A mixed reality game to gauge level of user engagement, task performance within the game and also trace the path leading to successful task completion. It is built using the Unity game engine for both a regular desktop version and the Oculus Rift HMD.The primary focus of the study was the comparison of desktops vs the HMDs using  the aforementioned values as  independent variables while also exploring exocentric vs endocentric approaches, the level of confusion factor, and the effect of the virtual avatar representations. The game was evaluated using a total of 18 subjects in accordance with the IRB protocol and the results were analyzed to bring forth statistically significant conclusions.
