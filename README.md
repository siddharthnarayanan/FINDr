Interactive search game that uses the Unity game engine. The game was built with the same resolution, field of view and input controls for both versions of the game. The game was also used to explore exocentric vs endocentric approaches, the level of confusion factor, and the effect of the virtual avatar representations, along with the situational awareness of the user when they play the game.
